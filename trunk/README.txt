To have the Client connect to the Server you have to sync the server and client
 config files (location in the Data folder at the root directory).

Client's having the same username is not supported.

To send a file:
 - Click on the name of the user to send the file to (the name will not
    highlight but trust us... it is selected). Then click the "Send File..."
    button which will open a "Open File Dialog" to let you choose what file to
    send to the selected user.
 - The user you sent the file to will then get a prompt to be able to accept or
    reject the incoming file.
 - If they accept the file, they will be prompted on where to save the file.
    (Default location should be the dropfolder within the Data folder.)

Note: If you close the client process while its trying to connect to the server
 when the server doesn't exists. It will take approx. 15 seconds before the
 program notifies you of the failer and then fully closes.
