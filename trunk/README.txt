To send a file, click on the name of the user to send the file to (the name will not highlight
 but it will be selected). Then click the "Send File..." button which will open a Open File Dialog
 to let you choose what file to send to the user selected.
 
The user you sent the file to will then get a prompt to be able to accept or reject the incoming file.

If they accept the file, they will be prompted on where to save the file. (Default location should be the
 dropfolder within the Data folder.)

We do have multiple file transfer working.

To connect to the Server you have to sync the server and client config files.
